**DAX Portal** is a next-generation **Operating-System-style portfolio platform**, engineered and designed by **Harsh Pandey**.  
It is not a traditional website — it is a **fully interactive system interface** that behaves like a real OS across **desktop and mobile**, complete with boot sequences, window/app management, system modules, and AI-assisted navigation.

> **DAX Portal is a system you _enter_, not a page you visit.**

## 🧠 About DAX Portal

DAX Portal is an **OS-grade interactive portfolio** built to demonstrate **system design, architectural thinking, and product-level execution**.

Unlike traditional portfolios that rely on scrolling pages, DAX simulates a real operating system experience:

- Boot & access animations
- Desktop environment with windows
- Mobile OS with fullscreen apps
- System terminology (Modules, Data Vault, Processes)
- Real interaction models instead of static UI

This project exists to answer one question:

> _What if a portfolio behaved like an operating system?_

---

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

DAX Portal is built on three fundamental principles:

### 1️⃣ OS-First Design

Everything behaves like a system:

- Booting
- Desktop
- Apps
- Windows
- Processes

### 2️⃣ Platform-Aware UX

Desktop and Mobile are **not responsive layouts**.  
They are **different operating paradigms**.

### 3️⃣ Modules, Not Pages

Every feature is a **module or process**, not a page.

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

```
Boot Layer
   ↓
Platform Detection
   ↓
Desktop OS  ←→  Mobile OS
   ↓
Modules / Windows / Apps
```

- Unified boot layer
- Platform-specific interaction engines
- Shared modules with adapted UX
- Deterministic system behavior

---

## 🖥️ Desktop OS Mode

Desktop DAX behaves like a real operating system.

### Features

- Boot & access sequence
- Desktop wallpaper system
- Dock / launcher
- Right-click context menu
- Draggable & focusable windows
- Z-index window management
- Minimize / close / restore logic
- Multiple windows running simultaneously
- Terminal module
- Finder-style Data Vault
- Live in-system code editor

### Architecture

- Central window manager
- Zustand + Immer for window state
- Stable drag & restore logic

---

## 📱 Mobile OS Mode

Mobile DAX is a **true mobile OS experience**, not a scaled desktop.

### Features

- Same boot sequence as Desktop
- Mobile home screen with icons & dock
- Fullscreen app launching
- Stack-based navigation
- Back-button controlled app lifecycle
- Finder / Data Vault as fullscreen app
- Touch-optimized interaction model

### Architecture

- Typed local state
- Fullscreen app stack
- Wrapper-based app container
- No overlapping windows by design

> Desktop = Window Manager  
> Mobile = App Stack Navigator

**DAX Portal is not a portfolio.**  
It is a **system you access**.
